# Format: noiseType noiseSpecificValues
# Where "noiseType" can be one of {"Unit", "Isotropic", "Diagonal", "Constrained"}
# and "noiseSpecificValues" specify the sigma values,
# the amount of values is dependent on "noiseType"
# The dimension of the noise is equal to 6.
# Matrix structure (from cam at row to cam at column) : Newline means next column; Empty line means next row, first column
